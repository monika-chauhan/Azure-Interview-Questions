Question1 : What tools can you use to manage Azure Blob Storage?
Answer : There are several tools you can use to manage Azure Blob Storage, including:
    1. Azure Storage Explorer :-> A desktop application that lets you manage Azure Storage resources, including blobs, files, queues, and 
tables. You can use it to upload, download, and manage resources across Azure regions, Azure Stack, and Azure Government.
    2. Azure PowerShell and CLI :-> You can use these to access Blob Storage data and perform standard storage management tasks. 
    3. Azure DSKs :-> You can use these to access Blob Storage data and integrate it with your application or service
    4. AzCopy :-> A command-line utility that copies files or blobs to or from a storage account. 
    5. Azure Monitor :-> You can use this to read metric values and filter them by using dimension values. 
    6. Azure Storage Emulator :-> You can use this for development and testing.
    7. Third-party tools :-> You can use third-party programs such as CloudBerry Explorer, Cyberduck, or Storage Made Easy

Question 2: What is the difference between page blobs and blocks?
Answer : Page blobs and block blobs are both types of Azure Blob storage, but they are designed for different purposes:
    1. Page Blobs :-> These are best for storing large, random-access files, like data disks and OS for virtual machines and databases. 
Page blobs are made up of 512-byte pages, and can store up to 8 TiB of data. They are optimized for random read and write operations, and 
are ideal for scenarios where you need to read and write small sections of a file without affecting the entire file. 
    2. Block Blob :-> These are best for storing large amounts of unstructured data, like text, images, videos, and logs. Block blobs are
made up of blocks of data, and can store up to 190.7 TiB of data. They are optimized for sequential IO, and are the most common type of 
blob. Block blobs can be uploaded in parallel, and each block can be up to 100 MB in size

Question 3: Can we change the types of blb after creations?
Answer : Once a blob is created, its type cannot be changed.

Question 4: Can you use more than one partition for a single table?
Answer : Yes, you can use more than one partition for a single table. Here are some benefits of using multiple partitions:
    1. mproved performance: Partitioned tables can improve query performance by reducing the number of bytes read by a query.
    2.Better cost control: Partitioned tables can help control costs by reducing the number of bytes read by a query.
    3.Greater backup flexibility: Creating multiple partitions can provide greater backup flexibility and reduce backup performance impacts.
    4.Improved restoration times: Creating multiple partitions can improve restoration times. 
    5.More efficient processing: Creating additional partitions can result in more efficient processing. 
    6.Faster query performance: Creating additional partitions can result in faster query performance.

You can use the ADD PARTITION clause to add a new data partition to an existing partitioned table.

Question 5: What type of files can you upload to Azure Blob Storage?
Answer : You can upload many types of files to Azure Blob Storage, including: Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, Multimedia images, Audio
files, and Video files. 
        Azure Blob Storage is a cloud-based object storage solution that's designed to store unstructured data. It's used for a variety of

Question 10: What are the key components of Azure Blob Storage?
Answer : The key components of Azure Blob Storage are: 
    1.Storage account :-> Specifies the namespace for the data, and each object stored in Azure Storage has a unique address linked to this
account. 
    2.Container :-> Acts as a directory that helps manage and establish blobs. A storage account can contain many containers, and a 
container can store many blobs. 
    3.Blob :-> An object in the form of unstructured data, such as images, audio, video, and files.
Azure Blob Storage also offers a range of features, including: 
    1.Security: Includes authentication with Microsoft Entra ID, role-based access control (RBAC), encryption at rest, and advanced threat
protection. 
    2.Data management: Includes end-to-end lifecycle management, policy-based access control, and immutable (WORM) storage. 
    3.Storage tiers: Includes hot, cool, and archive storage tiers for different use cases. 
    4.Support for development frameworks: Includes Java, .NET, Python, and Node.js. 

Question 11: What happens if a file gets damaged while you upload it to Azure?
Answer : If a file is damaged while uploading to Azure, it may not be detected at upload time because Azure Blob does not check the MD5. However, Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer will check the checksum when downloading and fail the download if the file is corrupted. 
        Action                   Result
        Undelete a blob          Restores any soft-deleted versions or snapshots, but not the base blob
        Undelete Blob operation  Restores a blob and any soft-deleted snapshots associated with it
A corrupted file is a damaged or incomplete digital document that may not open or work as intended. There are many reasons why a file may
become corrupted, including: hardware malfunctions, sudden power outages, software bugs, and malware

Question 12: How does Azure Blob Storage work?
Answer :  Azure Blob Storage is a service that allows users to store large amounts of data, such as images, videos and documents, in the 
cloud. You can store blobs in containers that are similar to folders. Each container can store an unlimited number of blobs. Each blob can
be up to 4.77 terabytes in size. Users may access blobs via HTTP or HTTPS using a unique URL, and a user can authenticate them using Azure
Active Directory or a shared access signature. Azure Blob Storage also supports versioning, data tiering and archiving, which helps 
optimise storage costs and data durability.

Question 13: Can you explain what object storage is in relation to Azure Blob Storage?
Answer : An object store is a data storage system designed to store, manage and retrieve data. This data can include images, videos and 
documents. They typically provide a simple key-value interface that assigns each object a unique key and associated metadata that a user 
can use to store and retrieve the object.

Question 14: What are the benefits of Azure Blob Storage?
Answer : An object store like Azure Blob storage has several key benefits, such as high scalability and durability. It also offers low 
costs for storing and retrieving large amounts of data. Object stores often provide built-in data tiering and archiving capabilities, which
can help to optimise storage costs and ensure that it protects the data from loss due to hardware failures, software bugs or other issues.


Question 15: Can you use Azure Blob Storage before installing software?
Answer : It is not necessary to install any software first. You can interact with Azure Blob Storage using Azure Storage SDKs, Azure 
PowerShell, Azure CLI or the Azure Storage REST API. These tools allow you to create, manage and access your Azure Blob Storage account and
its data.

Question 16: What are blob tiers in Azure Blob Storage?
Answer : A blob tier refers to the storage performance and cost associated with a specific type of blob. Azure Blob storage offers several
blob tiers. 
    1.The hot tier is optimised for frequently accessed data, or that which is accessed at least once a month, with the lowest storage cost.
    2.The cool tier is optimised for infrequently accessed data, or that which is accessed less than once a month, and has a higher storage cost than the hot tier. 
    3.The archive tier is optimised for long-term data retention, or that which is accessed less than once a year, and has the highest storage cost.

Question 17: What happens when you transition data to the archive tier?
Answer :  When you transition data to the archive tier, the system moves the data to a lower-cost storage option designed for long-term 
retention. Its purpose is to store data you plan to access infrequently, making it the lowest-cost storage option. Data in the archive tier
is no longer immediately available for read or write operations. The system transitions the data back to the hot or cool tier to access it.
This is the rehydration process, and it may take several hours to complete.

Question 18: How does the rehydration process work?
Answer: The rehydration process refers to restoring a previously frozen, or cool, tier blob to the hot storage tier. You can do this by 
accessing the blob or changing its properties. The duration of the process depends on the blob size and the rate at which the system can 
read it from cold storage. The user cannot modify or delete the blob until the rehydration process is complete because, until that time, it
is read-only. As this process takes time and costs extra money, it is recommended that you use it only infrequently.

Question 19 : What are the Azure Storage types?
Answer : Windows Azure Storage provides the infrastructure to store data. There are four main types: 
    1.Queues for informing between web parts and worker roles
    2.Tables for storing structural data
    3.BLOBs (Binary Large Objects) to store contents, records, or vast information
    4.Windows Azure Drives (VHD) to mount a page BLOB. These can be transferred and downloaded using BLOBs
